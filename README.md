In the interest of creating a space to share my work and a little bit about myself, I have created a github profile with several pages linked together.  These pages include an "about me" page to give a btrief overview of myself, a "contact" page where people can send a message to me and provide their email for a return reply, and a "portfolio" page to show off my work.  This portfolio will be a constantly evolving project, but from the start, I have made sure that:


*The various pages scale correctly with screen size so as to appear professional across multiple devices

*All links in the nav bar work and go to the correct page

*The nav bar maintains a consistent theme across all pages

*The HTML contains semantic elements and proper indendation for easier reading

*The use of bootstrap responsive elements limits the need for media queries


Using these aspects as a bedrock, I hope to ensure a strong foundation on which to build my professional Github profile.
